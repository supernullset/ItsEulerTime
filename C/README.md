Hey look - its project Euler in raw C!!

This will be interesting...

Here is what I am thinking - I want to develop each solution
independently for maybe the first 10 problems. After that, I want to
build a CLI application which will have a way to cache values that
each executable can rely on - Prim numbers come to mind, and maybe
some of the pyramidal/triplet computations which are reused in later
problems. It would be very cool if I could develop a little REPL for
interacting with the solutions and interactively executing them.
